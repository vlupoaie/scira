        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
         A wide variety of academic papers are published daily and searching for related literature can be a burden.
         SciRA, short for Scientific Research Smart Assistant is a smart platform able to provide an innovative experience
         regarding the references between papers. It integrates various data sources such as DBLP, Colinda, ACM, arxiv and
         DBPedia datasets, taking advantage of 2012 ACM Computing Classification System and offers a platform to upload
         and manage new publications, providing a recommendation system based on user's search history. The big amount of 
         data provided by the platform can be filtered by a series of custom attributes tailored to each user's needs.

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
        In the last years, the term Semantic Web receives more and more attention. With the variety of search engines
        available it is fairly easy for a human to search for academic literature but, searching for related papers is
        still a concern. SciRA incorporates the Semantic Web so that the data related to a scientific paper can be
        easily processed by machines. There are various linked data sets available on the internet, and SciRA incorporates
        these datasets alongside with its own publication platform, exposing a SPARQL endpoint to allow the user to
        retrieve data from all its sources. The platform is intended to be an invaluable resource while researching on a given
        topic, but can also be used by newcomers in learning a given subject.

      <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
         In the first section we briefly described the main goals of the application. The proposed project
         is based on a fat client - thin server architecture, exposing multiple independent microservices 
         providing a variety of functionalities such as publications querying, user management, recommendation system,
         graph visualization of publications and authors relations. <i>SciRA</i> has three main components which are 
         described in detail in the next subchapters:
         <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Client</b>: web pages that communicate with the server's exposed API. Can also be implemented on
            different platforms (such as mobile devices).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Server</b>: based on multiple components, processes client's requests, fetches information from external
            linked data sources and generates recommendations accustomed to each user.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Database</b>: stores information about subscribed users and their publications.
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <section id="server">
          <h3>Server</h3>
          <p>
            The server is based on the MVC (Model - View - Controller) design pattern:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Controller</b>: interacts with the clients through an API, using JSON-LD, and decides which
                microservices to use for processing the requests.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Model</b>: has multiple components focusing on different services:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <i>Search</i>: processes search input from the client, having three different implementations:
                    Simple (used for casual searches, combining keywords to find matching publications),
                    Advanced (combining multiple advanced filters in order to constraint the search domain
                              for more specific results),
                    Editor (exposes an endpoint where each subscribed user can submit his own SPARQL query).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i>SPARQL Parser</i>: based on the input from the search component, builds the SPARQL query
                    tailored to each endpoint (Colinda, DBLP, ACM, Arxiv, DBPedia or the local dataset) and retrieves
                    and combines the pieces of information acquired from the linked data endpoints.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i>Recommendation System</i>: used in generating recommendations for a specific user and for
                    providing related results for queried publications. The algorithm executes a fuzzy search taking
                    into consideration publications that have related topics, tags, authors, publication dates etc.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i>User Manager</i>: Manages all interactions of a user with the local database including
                    authentication, profile editing, publication uploading etc.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ul>

            When the server receives a request from the client, the controller processes it and decides which component 
            to use in order to provide the response. The main use case, available also to unregistered users, is submitting
            a search request. The user can opt for a quick, simple search or a more advanced one, based on different filters.
            In addition to this, the client can use the SPARQL editor to run his own query against an exposed endpoint.
            Subscribed users can also update their profile, upload publications (which will be stored in the local database)
            and view history and custom recommendations.

            <p>The figure below presents the class-diagram which describes the application by showing the system's classes,
              their attributes, methods and relationships among objects. The <i>Search</i> and the <i>SPARQL</i> component are
              implemented using the abstract factory design pattern, providing generic interfaces (<i>Search</i>, <i>Repository</i>)
              for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.</p>

        <section id="server">
          <h3>API</h3>
          <p>
            The server exposes two main API endpoints corresponding to the two main controller components 
            (Search and User Management). All client - server communication is done via the API which uses JSON-LD. We
            also provide an OpenAPI 2.0 specification that describes in detail each available path. Offering multiple HTTP methods
            through which the API can be used, the application integrates the whole CRUD spectrum.
          </p>
          <p>
            The user component provides all the necessary operations for user management (user creation, logging in,
            profile updates, publication view history and recommendations). A short description of each available operation can be seen in the figure below.
          </p>

          <p>
            The publication component handles all queries related to publications searching and recommandations. It is composed of three components
            which correspond to the three search components in the server (Simple Search, Advanced Search and Raw SPARQL Search) and also has a route
            for the recommendation system, in which, given a publication, similar ones are returned.
